                            While some process is executed some errors can be happened without knowing. Those exceptions
                            are called as runtime exception. And some errors can be occurred upon the data that you
                            pass. All those exceptions can be divided into two parts upon the retry capability.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What is retry capability?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Just imagine make a request to the payment service to make the payment. But at the moment
                            the request can be failed for mainly two reasons. One, the passing data is incorrect or the
                            customer balance is insufficient to process the execution. And the second one is, the
                            request can't achieve the payment service due to a network issue or, although the request
                            goes to the payment service, a database connection failure of the payment service database
                            can be effected to the request failure. So, passing incorrect data or inefficient balanne
                            are not retryable, because although we retried the process again and again, the same error
                            gets occurred every time. Because the reason is stable. But think about the second
                            reason. If it had a network issue in short period of time, the issue will be fixed soon.
                            Then the process can be invoked as usual. Most of the time, This kind of errors can be
                            runtime exception ( Io base exceptions/ network exceptions.) Other than that there can have
                            many exception upon your use-case. The programmer is the responsible person who decide the
                            exception is retryable or not.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Why we identify the retryable exception in stacksaga?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Retryable exception are not happened regularly. those exceptions are not accepted. Those are
                            very rare. You know in the microservices' architecture the main process have set of sequence
                            processes. We can't say how many number of steps are there. It will depend on your use-case.
                            Just think the whole process consist of 20 sub processes. 15 of process have been
                            successfully executed and the 16-step gets failed due to an issue. Then framework stop the
                            process and start the compensation process. While processing the compensations, one of
                            compensations is failed due to a network issue. Compensation transactions are Not just like
                            process executions,compensations is must. (if the process execution is failed at some point,
                            the compensation process can be executed. But if the compensation is failed we have nothing
                            to do anymore. If there's a compensation error, The transaction will be terminated and the
                            transaction is marked as garbage transaction.) Before terminate the transaction the
                            framework should know the error is caused due to a retryable exception or non retryable
                            exception. If it's a retryable exception the framework will keep the transaction pending to
                            execute that atomic compensation transaction after connection is fixed. If the reason is a
                            non retryable exception, the transaction will be marked as a garbage transaction by the
                            framework. That's why the retryable exceptions should be identified and inform about to the
                            framework.
