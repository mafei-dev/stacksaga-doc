                    <p>
                        Before dive in to the framework let's have the basic idea of microservice architecture.
                        <br/>
                        A microservices architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services. Each
                        service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded
                        context. A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit
                        boundary within which a domain model exists.
                    </p>
                    <h5 id="what-are-microservices">What are microservices?</h5>
                    <p>Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in
                        small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

                    </div>

                    <h2 id="database-per-service-pattern">Database per Service Pattern</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the benefits of microservice architecture is that it lets us choose the technology
                        stack per service. For instance, we can decide to use a relational database for service A
                        and opt for a NoSQL database for service B.

                        This model lets the services manage domain data independently on a data store that best
                        suites its data types and schema. Further, it also lets the service scale its datastores
                        on-demand and insulates it from the failures of other services.

                        However, at times a transaction can span across multiple services, and ensuring data
                        consistency across the service database is a challenge. In the next section, let us examine
                        the challenge of distributed transaction management with an example.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="distributed-transaction">Distributed Transaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        To demonstrate the use of distributed transactions, we’ll take an example of an e-commerce
                        application that processes online orders and is implemented with microservice architecture.
                        There is a microservice to create the orders, one that processes the payment, another that
                        updates the inventory and the last one that delivers the order. Each of these microservices
                        performs a local transaction to implement the individual functionalities:
                    </p>
                    <a target="_blank" href="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/distributed-transaction.png"><img
                            class="img-fluid  "
                            src="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/distributed-transaction.png" alt=""
                            title="distributed-transaction"/></a>
                    <p>
                        To ensure a successful order processing service, all four microservices must complete the
                        individual local transactions. If any of the microservice fails to complete its local
                        transaction, all of the completed preceding transactions should roll back to ensure data
                        integrity. This is an example of a distributed transaction as the transaction boundary
                        crosses multiple services and databases.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="challenges-of-distributed">Challenges of Distributed Transaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the previous section, we’ve provided a real-life example of a distributed transaction.
                        Distributed transactions in a microservice architecture pose two key challenges.

                        The first one is maintaining ACID. To ensure the correctness of a transaction, it must be
                        atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID). The atomicity ensures that all or none of
                        the steps of a transaction should complete. Consistency takes data from one valid state to
                        another valid state. Isolation guarantees that concurrent transactions should produce the
                        same result that sequentially transactions would have produced. Lastly, durability means
                        that committed transactions remain committed irrespective of any type of system failure. In
                        a distributed transaction scenario, as the transaction spans several services, it always
                        remains a key concern to ensure ACID.

                        The second one is managing the transaction isolation level. It specifies the amount of data
                        that is visible in a transaction when the other services access the same data
                        simultaneously. In other words, if one object in one of the microservice is persisted in the
                        database while another request reads the data, should the service return the old or new
                        data?
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="what-is-saga-architecture-pattern">What Is Saga Architecture Pattern?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Saga architecture pattern provides transaction management using a sequence of local
                        transactions. A local transaction is the unit of work performed by a saga participant. Every
                        operation that is part of the Saga can be rolled back by a compensating transaction.
                        Further, the Saga pattern guarantees that either all operations are complete successfully or
                        the corresponding compensation transactions are run to undo the work previously completed.
                        In the Saga pattern, a compensating transaction must be idempotent and retryable. These two
                        principles ensure that a transaction can be managed without any manual intervention. The
                        Saga Execution Coordinator (SEC) ensures guarantees these principles:
                    </p>

                    <p>The above diagram shows how to visualize the Saga pattern for the previously discussed online
                        order processing scenario.</p>

                    <h2 id="saga-orchestration-pattern">Saga Orchestration Pattern</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the Orchestration pattern, a single orchestrator is responsible for managing the overall
                        transaction status. If any of the microservice encounters a failure, then the orchestrator is
                        responsible for invoking the necessary compensating transactions.
                        The Saga orchestration pattern is useful for brownfield microservice application development
                        architecture. In other words, this pattern is suitable if we already have a set of microservices
                        and would like to implement the Saga pattern in the application. We need to define the
                        appropriate compensating transactions to proceed with this pattern.

                        According to the behaviours of the transaction we can mainly identify 3 transaction types
                        that can be happened when we use saga.

                        Just assume we have used 5 microservices to be executed and all of them have been worked
                        without any errors. Then there is no revert processes have been executed. That's means, all
                        the microservices are up and running and there haven't been occurred exceptions internally

                        In this time, An exception has occurred when one of microservices get execute. Just assume
                        coordinator has been executed 3 microservices successfully but at the 4th one, an error has
                        occurred due to a network exception or whatever internal exception that the microservices
                        has been thrown. Now the coordinator has to execute revert function regarding the all
                        microservices that executed earlier. So the coordinator will start to execute all the revert
                        functions one by one as a sequence. If those revert functions has been executed
                        successfully, this kind of transactions are going to these types. Simply we did a set of
                        transactions but unfortunately got an error but all the revert processes are done
                        successfully.

                        In this time, the coordinator try to execute the transactions one by one. But while doing
                        the execution, an error get occurred after doing some executions and the coordinator get
                        started to execute all the revert processes that regards to the microservices that
                        previously executed. But unfortunately while doing the revert executions an error get
                        occurred because of a network issues. (Network issues means it can be happened because of
                        there is no endpoint in active at that time or kind of actual network problems)
