                        This the final step of the entire series of microservice example by using Stacksaga framework.
                        to test the all features of the framework, we have to check the same place-order request under
                        many situation. because, there are <a
                            href="./../../../../how-works-stack-saga-transaction-types.html">3type of transactions</a>
                        can be identified as the framework
                        mentioned. let's try to move to them one by one. and in this final step you will be learning how
                        the
                        <a href="./../../../../topics/stacksaga-admin-dashboard.html">Stacksaga Admin dashboard</a> is
                        used to
                        see
                        all the statistics and the transaction details we made.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Testing of Fully success transaction scenario.</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the 1st shep of the transaction can be happened in Saga design pattern. That means all
                        the service which took part to the place-order process will be successfully executed without any
                        exception smoothly as we expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        for now, your entire set of applications are running on well. all service has at leas one
                        service-instance running on. we expect that the process will be done without any error. if the
                        process has no any error. that means there is no any compensation for the transaction. it is
                        just like the place-order process that we tested at the 1st example without using Stacksaga.
                        because, it will not have any compensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        let's make the request by using the postman like below by providing the data should be passed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now you can see in the post response tab, the response has been returned in a flash. about 20
                        milliseconds. because the whole process has been taken by Stacksaga. and return the transaction
                        uid (AggregatorUid) and we have built our custom response object by using it. afterword, SEC
                        will be taking care of the transaction all do all the execution as you guided the SEC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        see the log, you can see all the logs we have put in each executors was printed out. all the
                        processes are successfully executed and as well as the callback methods (Event-Listener methods)
                        have been invoked by the SEC. you can see in the log, the <code>onEachRevertPerformed</code> has
                        been invoked each time when the executors successfully executed. and finally the <code>onTransactionCompleted</code>
                        method has been invoked by the SEC to notify you about the successful transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here there is nothing new to you. as the next step, we are going to test the transaction type of
                        <b>Revert success transaction scenario.</b>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Testing of Revert success transaction scenario.</h3>
                    <p>
                        This testing part might be quite new to you. because this is the time we can see the main
                        concept of the Saga design pattern. that means the transaction is going to be failed after some
                        done some executions. on other hand the full process will not be success due to an error that
                        happens while the process. the error can be expected one or unexpected error.
                        The expected error means you have thrown the error by knowing the process will not be executed
                        forward anymore and, stop the process and do the compensations for each executed process. <a
                            href="./../../../../topics/retryable-exception-vs-non-retryable-exception.html">see more</a>
                        about the exception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        to overcome that kind of expected error, we can change the activeness of the user in the user
                        service. but we check the user service at the 1st. therefore, we are not going to do that. but
                        keep it in your mind that if happens that kind of error, it's called as excepted error. we don't
                        want to identify the error in the process forward (process-exception) but here we have mentioned
                        that only for you understanding. all the error that happen in the execution-process the SEC will
                        catch and start the compensation process even if you caught the error and throw. don't worry
                        about that. but as a best practice, handling exception is useful when get an error and to see
                        the log by using Stacksaga admin dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        interns of the example, the best place to make an exception is the last one. that is the
                        displacing process. we are going to make an artificial exception by stopping the delivery
                        service. then the process start and go forward but the <code>PODispatchExecutor</code> try to
                        execute the process, nut the process can't be done successfully. because there is no any
                        delivery-service is running on. (we have downed the server.) then the SEC has started invoking
                        the compensations methods as the descending order. (last to first) you can see the log. until
                        the process execution of
                    </p>
