                    <p>
                        Before dive in to the framework let's have the basic idea of microservice architecture.
                        <br/>
                        A microservices architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services. Each
                        service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded
                        context. A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit
                        boundary within which a domain model exists.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What are microservices?</h5>
                    <p>Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in
                        small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

                    <div>
                        <a target="_blank" href="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/Slide8.svg"><img
                                class="img-fluid  "
                                src="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/Slide8.svg" alt=""
                                title="CoderPro Home Page"/></a>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Database per Service Pattern</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the benefits of microservice architecture is that it lets us choose the technology
                        stack per service. For instance, we can decide to use a relational database for service A
                        and opt for a NoSQL database for service B.

                        This model lets the services manage domain data independently on a data store that best
                        suites its data types and schema. Further, it also lets the service scale its datastores
                        on-demand and insulates it from the failures of other services.

                        However, at times a transaction can span across multiple services, and ensuring data
                        consistency across the service database is a challenge. In the next section, let us examine
                        the challenge of distributed transaction management with an example.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Distributed Transaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        To demonstrate the use of distributed transactions, we’ll take an example of an e-commerce
                        application that processes online orders and is implemented with microservice architecture.
                        There is a microservice to create the orders, one that processes the payment, another that
                        updates the inventory and the last one that delivers the order. Each of these microservices
                        performs a local transaction to implement the individual functionalities:
                    </p>
                    <a target="_blank" href="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/distributed-transaction.png"><img
                            class="img-fluid  "
                            src="../../assets/images/architecture/1.0/distributed-transaction.png" alt=""
                            title="distributed-transaction"/></a>
                    <p>
                        To ensure a successful order processing service, all four microservices must complete the
                        individual local transactions. If any of the microservice fails to complete its local
                        transaction, all of the completed preceding transactions should roll back to ensure data
                        integrity. This is an example of a distributed transaction as the transaction boundary
                        crosses multiple services and databases.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Challenges of Distributed Transaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the previous section, we’ve provided a real-life example of a distributed transaction.
                        Distributed transactions in a microservice architecture pose two key challenges.

                        The first one is maintaining ACID. To ensure the correctness of a transaction, it must be
                        atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID). The atomicity ensures that all or none of
                        the steps of a transaction should complete. Consistency takes data from one valid state to
                        another valid state. Isolation guarantees that concurrent transactions should produce the
                        same result that sequentially transactions would have produced. Lastly, durability means
                        that committed transactions remain committed irrespective of any type of system failure. In
                        a distributed transaction scenario, as the transaction spans several services, it always
                        remains a key concern to ensure ACID.

                        The second one is managing the transaction isolation level. It specifies the amount of data
                        that is visible in a transaction when the other services access the same data
                        simultaneously. In other words, if one object in one of the microservice is persisted in the
                        database while another request reads the data, should the service return the old or new
                        data?
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Is Saga Architecture Pattern?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Saga architecture pattern provides transaction management using a sequence of local
                        transactions. A local transaction is the unit of work performed by a saga participant. Every
                        operation that is part of the Saga can be rolled back by a compensating transaction.
                        Further, the Saga pattern guarantees that either all operations are complete successfully or
                        the corresponding compensation transactions are run to undo the work previously completed.
                        In the Saga pattern, a compensating transaction must be idempotent and retryable. These two
                        principles ensure that a transaction can be managed without any manual intervention. The
                        Saga Execution Coordinator (SEC) ensures guarantees these principles:

                        As we discussed earlier, we had used number of microservices for doing one single execution.
                        Just assume we have used 5 microservices to be executed and all of them have been worked
                        without any errors. Then there is no revert processes have been executed. That's means, all
                        the microservices are up and running and there haven't been occurred exceptions internally
                        inside each microservice.

                        In this time, An exception has occurred when one of microservices get execute. Just assume
                        coordinator has been executed 3 microservices successfully but at the 4th one, an error has
                        occurred due to a network exception or whatever internal exception that the microservices
                        has been thrown. Now the coordinator has to execute revert function regarding the all
                        microservices that executed earlier. So the coordinator will start to execute all the revert
                        functions one by one as a sequence. If those revert functions has been executed
                        successfully, this kind of transactions are going to these types. Simply we did a set of
                        transactions but unfortunately got an error but all the revert processes are done
                        successfully.

                        In this time, the coordinator try to execute the transactions one by one. But while doing
                        the execution, an error get occurred after doing some executions and the coordinator get
                        started to execute all the revert processes that regards to the microservices that
                        previously executed. But unfortunately while doing the revert executions an error get
                        occurred because of a network issues. (Network issues means it can be happened because of
                        there is no endpoint in active at that time or kind of actual network problems)

                    <p>
                        As you know we have to communicate multiple microservices when we are going with
                        microservices architecture. If we don't use stackSAGA framework you can use call your
                        another microservice by using http client or whatever related protocol method for that
                        particular microservice inside your single method. Just assume you have to communicate with
                        100 of microservices to do a transaction. Then you have to call those 100 microservices one
                        by one inside your single method. And you can't get understand clearly those steps. But
                        if you use stackSAGA, we don't have to worry about it. You have a template to implement and
                        store the transaction in a clear mechanism. Those implemented classes called as executors.
                        In other words, the classes are responsible for doing transactions and doing revert
                        processes regarding each microservice called as executors.

                        Assume you are going to do a transaction with 10 microservices' endpoint. Some microservices
                        might be services that data change in their database due to the calling. As an example if it
                        was update stock endpoint, exactly the stocks will be updated due to the calling it.
                        According to the saga pattern every command executions like this have a compensation

                        we should recover the updated data. The classes which doing this kind of execution called as
                        command executors.

                    <P>
                        Stacksaga goes with a unique design pattern called "one controller per transaction". One
                        transaction has a one aggregator. An aggregator workers as a identifier as we as the dataset of
                        your transaction.

                    <p>

                        all the classes regarding the transaction will be related with the aggregator class. Without
                        keeping a relation with aggregator those classes will not be able to go through the stackSAGA
                        coordinator. Check out the code example.

                        Aggregator act as the dataset container throughout entire transaction. If you are going to do a
                        transaction, you want some data to pass to the service. Those data is stored in the aggregator.

                        StackSAGA framework mainly focus on saga orchestration design pattern. The main
                        responsibility is, manage
                        all the execution for each microservice one by one. And if an error occurred, do a
                        compensation for all executed transactions that affected to the database due to the
                        transaction that been happening until the error and keep all the states of each transaction
                        as can be replied in a store. As well as the framework provides you to a clean and clear
                        architecture to store your code regarding each microservice instead of calling all the
                        microservices inside your boilerplate single method. If you use stackSAGA framework you
                        don't want to worry about the compensation and other boring stuff, because the only thing
                        you have to do is, provide your logic inside of <a href="#">saga executors</a>. Then the
                        StackSAGA
                        coordinator will coordinate all the microservices and if an error occurred the coordinator
                        has the knowledge to undo all the execution that been doing until now.

                        If you are use stackSAGA for all microservices (with spring boot), the framework can
                        identify the active services and broken down services. Because stackSAGA uses redis server
                        internally to communicate through each microservice. <a href="#">Read more..</a>

                    <p>
                        The framework provides you to do the transaction multiple ways as synchronous way,
                        asynchronous way, and hybrid way

                        The framework provides a dashboard to see all the executed transactions and how the

                        without any errors. Then there is no revert processes have been executed. That's means, all
                        the microservices are up and running and there haven't been occurred exceptions internally
                        inside each microservice.

                        In this time, An exception has occurred when one of microservices get execute. Just assume
                        coordinator has been executed 3 microservices successfully but at the 4th one, an error has
                        occurred due to a network exception or whatever internal exception that the microservices
                        has been thrown. Now the coordinator has to execute revert function regarding the all
                        microservices that executed earlier. So the coordinator will start to execute all the revert
                        functions one by one as a sequence. If those revert functions has been executed
                        successfully, this kind of transactions are going to these types. Simply we did a set of
                        transactions but unfortunately got an error but all the revert processes are done
                        successfully.

                            you are already know that you can use the main server that you want to start the
                            transaction as the coordinator. Then it will act as a coordinator as well as a
                            microservice. Therefore, the first execution will be a self transaction. (The request
                            not
                            going to another service).

                            after saving the event state in the store the main service class will be notified as one

                            The stackSAGA coordinator (SSC) knows the process is completed now. Therefore, it will
                            notify to the onComplete method inside the controller (it is an Asynchronous
                            invocation).

                            R9 after completing all the process SSC returns to the controller with all the

                        In this time, the coordinator try to execute the transactions one by one. But while doing
                        the execution, an error get occurred after doing some executions and the coordinator get
                        started to execute all the revert processes that regards to the microservices that
                        previously executed. But unfortunately while doing the revert executions an error get
                        occurred because of a network issues. (Network issues means it can be happened because of
                        there is no endpoint in active at that time or kind of actual network problems)
