                        If you are use stackSAGA for all microservices (with spring boot), the framework can
                        identify the active services and broken down services. Because stackSAGA uses redis server
                        internally to communicate through each microservice. <a href="#">Read more..</a>

                    <p>
                        The framework provides you to do the transaction multiple ways as synchronous way,
                        asynchronous way, and hybrid way

                        The framework provides a dashboard to see all the executed transactions and how the
                        transaction got behave.

                    <h2>How works StackSaga</h2>


                    <p>
                        First, the request comes to the controller layer, and you can create the <a
                            href="./topics/aggregator.html">aggregator</a> object by
                        using the data initial data there which you got from the request. After creating the initial
                        aggregator object, you can send that aggregator object, and the transaction <a
                            href="./topics/executor.html">start-executor</a> class
                        by using the SagaTemplate which you have auto-wired. After that, the (<a
                            href="./topics/SEC.html" target="_blank">SEC</a>) will
                        take care of the request, and you will be updated with each and every step into the <a
                            target="_blank" href="./topics/handler.html">handler</a> that
                        you provided regarding the aggregator of the transaction asynchronously.
                    </p>

                    <!--Fire And Forget start-->

                    <p>You know that in the saga flow, the transaction can be divided into <a target="_blank"

                        types</a> according to
                        the behaviour of the transaction. let's see one by one how the StackSaga's execution-coordinator

                            the request mapping method will catch the request handover the process into stack

                        Just assume we have used 5 microservices to be executed and all of them have been worked
                        without any errors. Then there is no revert processes have been executed. That's means, all
                        the microservices are up and running and there haven't been occurred exceptions internally
                        inside each microservice.

                        In this time, An exception has occurred when one of microservices get execute. Just assume
                        coordinator has been executed 3 microservices successfully but at the 4th one, an error has
                        occurred due to a network exception or whatever internal exception that the microservices
                        has been thrown. Now the coordinator has to execute revert function regarding the all
                        microservices that executed earlier. So the coordinator will start to execute all the revert
                        functions one by one as a sequence. If those revert functions has been executed
                        successfully, this kind of transactions are going to these types. Simply we did a set of
                        transactions but unfortunately got an error but all the revert processes are done
                        successfully.

                            the request mapping method will catch the request handover the process into stack
                            saga template (stack saga state machine). After that the SSSM will take care of all the
                            process onwards.

                        the execution, an error get occurred after doing some executions and the coordinator get
                        started to execute all the revert processes that regards to the microservices that
                        previously executed. But unfortunately while doing the revert executions an error get
                        occurred because of a network issues. (Network issues means it can be happened because of
                        there is no endpoint in active at that time or kind of actual network problems)
